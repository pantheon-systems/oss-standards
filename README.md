# Pantheon Open Source Repo Standards (WIP)

[![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pantheon-Deprecated-yellow?logo=pantheon&color=FFDC28)](https://pantheon.io/docs/oss-support-levels#deprecated)


We hope this will: 

- provide context to customers who are using these projects and help answer their questions (i.e is this project supported, how often are there maintenance updates, will someone review my issues or pull requests?)
- support the sustainability of these open source repos and technical debt when teams and priortities change

## Project Details

**related projects**
- It would be great if each OS project included a list of the repos it was related to - we do a lot of jumping around to see where things are coming from sometimes.

**roadmap or future plan**
- It would be great if projects had some form of a roadmap to demonstrate transparency on where they're headed
- for example: [badges/shield](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1awkf14GL0PYNC7Nv0lup4sPyphNCIrV7bIJx5awlfpc/edit) or [nvm-sh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)
